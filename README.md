# ATDMNet
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model using PyTorch, designed for feature extraction and enhancement through convolutional layers, attention mechanisms, and pixel shuffle upsampling. The model integrates a custom encoder with several convolutional and attention layers, specifically targeting computer vision tasks.

## Overview
![image](free/new1.jpg)
The core architecture is composed of:
- **Encoder**: A pretrained ResNet (or another encoder like EfficientNet) to extract initial features from input images.
- **GFM (Global Feature Map)**: Several convolutional layers and MLP blocks for processing features at different stages.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Attention layers are applied at different stages of the model to refine and emphasize critical features.
- **Upsampling and Pixel Shuffle**: Upsampling is used to refine feature maps at various scales.

The output of the model is a series of feature maps, processed through the attention mechanism, which can be used for various downstream tasks like segmentation, object detection, or feature refinement.
